 Stock Prediction Using LSTM – Step-by-Step Guide
1️⃣ Data Collection
🔹 Objective: Fetch historical stock price data for analysis and prediction.
🔹 Process:

Use Yahoo Finance (yfinance) API to download stock data (Apple AAPL) from 2010 to 2019.
Store data in a structured pandas DataFrame.
🔹 Key Fields: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🔹 Objective: Analyze stock price trends and moving averages.
🔹 Process:

Plot closing prices over time to understand trends.
Calculate 100-day & 200-day moving averages to smooth fluctuations.
Identify patterns in stock price movement.
3️⃣ Data Preprocessing
🔹 Objective: Prepare data for training the LSTM model.
🔹 Process:

Split data into 70% training and 30% testing sets.
Apply MinMaxScaler to normalize stock prices between 0 and 1.
Create X_train & Y_train by using 100 past days as input and next stock price as output.
4️⃣ Building the LSTM Model
🔹 Objective: Design a deep learning model to predict future stock prices.
🔹 Model Architecture:

4 LSTM layers with ReLU activation.
Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
Dense output layer to predict stock price.
Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error loss function.
5️⃣ Model Training
🔹 Objective: Train the LSTM model with historical stock price data.
🔹 Process:

Train the model for 50 epochs to learn stock price patterns.
Save the trained model for future use.
6️⃣ Data Preparation for Testing
🔹 Objective: Format test data to evaluate the model.
🔹 Process:

Take the last 100 days from training data.
Merge it with testing data and apply MinMaxScaler.
7️⃣ Making Predictions
🔹 Objective: Use the trained model to predict stock prices.
🔹 Process:

Input the prepared test data into the LSTM model.
Convert scaled predictions back to original stock price values.
8️⃣ Performance Evaluation & Visualization
🔹 Objective: Compare actual vs. predicted stock prices.
🔹 Process:

Plot actual stock prices (blue) vs. predicted prices (red).
Identify model accuracy and performance trends.
9️⃣ Deploying the Project & GitHub Integration
🔹 Objective: Store and share project files on GitHub.
🔹 Process:
